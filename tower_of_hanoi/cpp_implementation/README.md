# Project Title:
Tower of Hanoi

# Description:
This project:
+ is implemented in C++.
+ is used to simulate the popular recursive game: Tower of Hanoi. Check here for more information: [Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi)
+ is to show the implementation of Stack structures and using recursive functions.

# Features:
+ thn_play_game.cpp is a file where you can play the tower of Hanoi game with the input n being the number of stacks.
+ thn_solution.cpp is a file to show the optimal number of ways to solve the game.

# How to use:
+ To play the game, open the terminal, run g++ thn_play_game.cpp stack/stack.cpp and then ./a.exe, then input n, starting rod and ending rod to play.
+ To see the optimal solution, run g++ thn_solution.cpp and then ./a.exe, then input n, starting rod and ending rod to see the solution.
